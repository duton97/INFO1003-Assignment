                Your heart is the first to develop in the womb and from the moment you are born, your heart begins its life-long task of maintaining constant and rhythmic contractions, ensuring efficient blood circulation so all the cells in your body can remove waste and obtain the nutrients they need to function. <br>
                Needless to say, your heart is the reason you are alive. <br>
                However, over a lifespan, many things can happen within your body that can prove to be damaging for your heart, with the potential to compromise its function. <br>
                    The most common of these conditions is cardiovascular disease (CVD). <br><strong>Want to know about heart attacks? <a href="heartattack.html">Click here!</a></strong><br>

                Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a broad classification of heart and blood vessel pathologies, and the number one cause of morbidity and mortality in Western countries. <br>
                The main types of CVD in Australia are: <br>

              <div class="section">
               <p>
                CVD is predominantly caused by atherosclerosis- a build-up of fatty plaques inside blood vessel walls, increasing resistance of blood flow and thus resulting in high blood pressure. <br>
                Predisposition to cardiovascular disease is caused by a combination of lifestyle factors (modifiable risk factors) and genetics (non-modifiable risk factors), which in turn can inform your predisposition to atherosclerosis. Unfortunately, if you have a family history of                           cardiovascular disease, you will increase your risk of being affected by CVD.<br>
                However it is important to note that aside from congenital heart disease, many of these pathologies are <strong>preventable</strong>. <br>
                This makes it all the more important to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle (modifiable risk factors) to reduce your risk of getting CVD!

              Coronary Heart Disease is the most common form of CVD. <br>
                  There are two major clinical forms: <strong>angina</strong> and <strong>heart attacks </strong>(acute myocardial infarction).
                  <strong>Angina</strong> is a chronic condition whereby severe chest pain is experienced through temporary loss of blood supply to the heart. Although it is generally not life-threatening, it increases the risk for sudden cardiac death or heart attacks. New onset of angina (unstable angina) however, must be treated immediately as it can be life-threatening and may result in sudden death. <br>
                  <strong>Heart attacks</strong> are caused when a heart (coronary) blood vessel is suddenly blocked, leading to inadequate blood supply and subsequently damage to the contractile heart muscle. It is life-threatening and must be treated immediately.

              <p id="stroke">
              <div id="header3">Stroke</div>
              Stroke is a blockage or haemorrhage of a blood vessel to the brain, resulting in brain damage or damage. As the brain is in charge of many functions, this may impair communication, hearing, movement, judgement and thinking depending on which part of the brain is affected. A stroke is usually fatal.
              There are two types of stroke: vessel blockage (ischaemic stroke) or vessel rupturing (haemorrhagic stroke).
              Both ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke can be caused by atherosclerosis.
              Additionally there can be transient ischaemic attacks whereby a temporary loss of blood supply (a few mins) to the brain can cause stroke-like symptoms that disappear within 24 hours.<br>

              <div id="header3">Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathy</div>
                  <strong>Heart failure</strong> occurs when a heart is unable to maintain a robust blood flow, resulting in chronic fatigue, reduced exercise capacity and shortness of breath. It is a life-threatening condition that usually cannot be cured. It is a consequence of heart conditions that reduce its function or increase its load such as high blood pressure, heart attack or cardiomyopathy. <br>

                  <strong>Cardiomyopathy</strong> occurs over a long period of time due to continual high blood pressure. High blood pressure increases demand for the heart to work harder to maintain the same blood circulation for survival. As the heart is a muscle, the heart muscle cells (myocardium) will grow in response to this long-term increase in demand. Unfortunately, there is only so much space for the heart to grow inside your body, and also a thickening in the myocardium actually reduces the elasticity of the heart and makes it stiffer, reducing the effectiveness of the heart, which in turn can lead to heart failure.

              <p id="pvd">
                Peripheral vascular disease is the obstruction of large arteries supplying blood to the peripheries (excl. heart and brain), narrowing the blood supply to the arms, legs and feet, potentially resulting in gangrene and subsequently the amputation of a limb.
It can result from atherosclerosis of the peripheral arteries and abdominal aortic aneurysm.

      Congenital heart disease refers to any heart or central blood vessel pathologies that are present at birth. It is one of the leading causes of death in the first year of life.
Symptoms include: breathlessness, failure to attain normal growth and development.
Symptoms are typically seen at birth or sometime thereafter.<br>
Congenital heart disease has the potential to be treated by surgery in infancy or early childhood (AIHW, 2015).
