                CVD is predominantly caused by atherosclerosis- a build-up of fatty plaques inside blood vessel walls, increasing resistance of blood flow and thus resulting in high blood pressure. <br>
                Predisposition to cardiovascular disease is caused by a combination of lifestyle factors (modifiable risk factors) and genetics (non-modifiable risk factors), which in turn can inform your predisposition to atherosclerosis. Unfortunately, if you have a family history of cardiovascular disease, you will increase your risk of being affected by CVD.<br>
                However it is important to note that aside from congenital heart disease, many of these pathologies are <strong>preventable</strong>. <br>
                This makes it all theactivity more important to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle (modifiable risk factors) to reduce your risk of getting CVD!

              <div id="header3">Smoking </div>
              Lifetime <strong>smoking</strong> roughly doubles your risk of developing heart disease. The chemicals in tobacco get into the bloodstream from the lungs. They damage the blood vessels (arteries) and other parts of the body. Your risk of having a stroke, and developing other diseases such as lung cancer are also increased. <br>
              Stopping smoking is often the single most effective thing that a person can do to reduce their health risk. The increased risk falls rapidly after smoking is stopped (although it takes a few years before the excess risk reduces completely). <br><p class="pull-right"><a href="#container">Back to top</a></p><br>

              <div id="header3">Lack of Physical Activity</div>
              People who are physically active have a lower risk of developing cardiovascular diseases compared with inactive people.
              To gain health benefits you should do at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity, on most days (at least five days per week).<br>
              <li><strong>30 minutes in a day</strong> is probably the minimum to gain health benefits. However, you do not have to do this all at once. For example, cycling to work and back 15 minutes each way adds up to the total of 30 minutes.
              <li><strong>Moderate physical activity</strong> means that you get warm, mildly out of breath, and mildly sweaty. For example, brisk walking, jogging, swimming, cycling, etc. However, research studies do suggest that the more vigorous the exercise, the better for health - particularly for preventing heart disease.
              <li><strong>On most days.</strong> You cannot store up the benefits of physical activity. You need to do it regularly.

              If you are overweight, you are more likely to develop cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, or certain cancers. The increased health risk of obesity is most marked when the excess fat is mainly in the tummy (abdomen) rather than on the hips and thighs. As a rule, a waist measurement of 102 cm or above for men
              (92 cm for Asian men) and 88 cm or above for women (78 cm for Asian women) is a significant health risk.<br>

                Eating healthily helps to <strong>control obesity</strong>, and <strong>lower your cholesterol level.</strong> Both of these help to reduce your health risk. Also, there is some evidence that eating oily fish (herring, sardines, mackerel, salmon, kippers, pilchards, fresh tuna, etc) helps to protect against heart disease. It is probably the omega-3 fatty acids in the fish oil that help to reduce the build-up of small fatty lumps called atheroma. Also, fruit and vegetables, as well as being low in fat, also contain antioxidants and vitamins which may help to prevent atheroma from building up. Briefly, a healthy diet means:
              </p>
              <li><strong>AT LEAST</strong> five portions, or ideally 7-9 portions, of a variety of fruit and vegetables per day.
              <li><strong>A THIRD OF MOST MEALS</strong> should be starch-based foods (such as cereals, wholegrain bread, potatoes, rice, pasta), plus fruit and vegetables.
              <li><strong>NOT MUCH</strong> fatty food such as fatty meats, cheeses, full-cream milk, fried food, butter, etc. Use low-fat, mono-unsaturated or polyunsaturated spreads. One study conducted at Harvard University found that replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats is an effective way of lowering your risk of heart attacks and other serious problems from heart disease.
              <li><strong>INCLUDE</strong> INCLUDE 2-3 portions of fish per week, at least one of which should be oily (such as herring, mackerel, sardines, kippers, salmon, or fresh tuna).
              <li><strong>LIMIT SALT</strong> to no more than 5 g a day (and less for children). See below for details.
              <li>If you eat meat, it is best to eat lean meat, or poultry such as chicken.
              <li>If you do fry, choose a vegetable oil such as sunflower, rapeseed or olive.

            <div id="header3">Salt</div>
              <p id="salt">
                Adults should eat no more than 5 g of salt a day. This is about a teaspoon of salt. <br>
                Even a modest reduction in intake can make quite a big difference. <br>
                The current average daily intake of salt in the UK is 9 g per day. About three quarters of the salt we eat is already in the foods we buy. Simply checking food labels and choosing foods with lower salt options can make a big difference. A tip: sodium is usually listed on the food label. Multiplying the sodium content by 2.5 will give the salt content. Also, try not to add salt to food at the table.

                Drinking a small or moderate amount of alcohol probably reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (38% compared with teetotallers in one study). That is, 1-2 units per day - which is up to 14 units per week. Drinking more than 15 units per week does not reduce the risk, and drinking more than the recommended upper limits can be harmful. That is, men should drink no more than 21 units per week (and no more than four units in any one day). Women should drink no more than 14 units per week (and no more than three units in any one day). One unit is in about half a pint of normal-strength beer, or two thirds of a small glass of wine, or one small pub measure of spirits.
